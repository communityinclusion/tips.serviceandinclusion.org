<div class="panel">
<p><strong>INCLUSION TIPs</strong> address all aspects of diversity, including disability. Including individuals with all abilities need not always be costly, complex or difficult. Most of our INCLUSION TIPs can be implemented quickly, with little to no expense, and integrated within your existing operations, policies and practices. </p>

<p>We hope you find these helpful, and invite you to share INCLUSION TIPs. We welcome any feedback you may have for us. Also, if you have a successful practice or tip you'd like to share please write us at nsip@umb.edu. </p>
