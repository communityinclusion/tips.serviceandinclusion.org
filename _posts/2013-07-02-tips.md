###Inclusion TIP #7: Scent-Free Policies

Institute a scent-free policy in your organization or agency.

The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) describes fragrance sensitivity as "an irritation or an allergic reaction to some chemical, or combination of chemicals, in a product" [http://askjan.org/media/fragrance.html] (http://askjan.org/media/fragrance.html). Scented products we use on a daily basis (cleaning products, perfumes, air fresheners, etc.) may contain scents that impact others' health and comfort level. Creating a policy that explicitly outlines your organization's goals for an allergy- and irritation-free zone can promote a more inclusive environment by making scent-free the standard. Anticipating the needs of those with allergies, respiratory illness, and other sensitivities to scents helps move your organization from the need of an individual to request an accommodation to true inclusion of all ways of being.
 
Here is an example of a scent-free policy from the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety: [http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/scent_free.html#_1_9] (http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/scent_free.html#_1_9 ). You may also find specific examples of language used around scent-free policies for staff communications, memos, and other forms of policy language on the JAN website (see the link to the JAN website above).

###Inclusion TIP #6: Walkathons, Gift Drives, Fundraisers

Becoming a more inclusive organization that puts diversity and equal participation for all its members at the core of its culture can be reflected in its participation in community-based activities. Look for opportunities in your area to contribute to fundraising and other efforts to support socially-minded missions that benefits individuals from different identity groups and life experiences, such as low-income and homeless community members, people with disabilities, and people struggling with diseases such as AIDS. Encouraging your team to give back to the local community and its diverse members reflects a similar mission within your organization while representing this mission as you benefit from free self-promotion in your local area.

Information for local opportunities to participate in fundraising and other efforts can be found on community websites in your area; examples include [MassEquality](http://www.massequality.org/), [Special Olympics Chicago] (http://www.allcommunityevents.com/chi_town_half_marathon/chi_town_half_mar_charity.html), and the [Avon Walk for Breast Cancer] (http://www.avonwalk.org/new-york/fundraising.html).

###INCLUSION TIP #5: Does your leadership represent diversity?
 
To ensure your organization is truly inclusive, start at the top with your advisory or governing board, commission or council. Does your leadership represent diversity? Identify individual board members' skills, professional expertise, and life experiences so that you can analyze what strengths you have today and what you will need in the future. A qualified board member with personal and/or professional experience with disability can assist an organization in being welcoming, accessible and accommodating to individuals with disabilities.

###INCLUSION TIP #4: Create a Diversity Calendar

Diversity is not only a representation of different cultural categories and values in an organization; it also represents a dialog between those belonging to different groups as they contribute to a community that values each voice and perspective as well as the whole. One way to invite these contributions is to create a diversity calendar to be posted in common areas of your organization. Such a calendar may include religious, secular, local, non-American and international holidays, as well as landmark legal decisions and markers of social and political change (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, effective July 26, 1990). Creating a diversity calendar can provide both the opportunity for members of your team to recognize cultural celebrations of all types, as well as the means to learn more about each other by sharing these celebrations.   

Here is a good example of a diversity calendar, which you can use as a model or a starting point for your organization: [http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf](http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf)

###INCLUSION TIP #3: Post Traumatic Stress (PTS)  
Post Traumatic Stress (PTS) is a debilitating condition that can occur after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Many people with PTS may re-experience the incident in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts, especially when they are exposed to events or objects that recall the trauma. Providing a secure, private room or quiet, enclosed space can allow the individual to reduce stress or comfortably practice relaxation exercises. Offering a private office space might also benefit others including nursing mothers or individuals who need make a call to their doctors or counselors. Identifying this space before anyone has to ask for this accommodation and advertising openly to all staff and members is a positive inclusive practice!   

To learn more about those who are affected by PTS, here are some websites to gather more information or resources:

- JAN Accommodation Resources  [http://askjan.org/media/ptsd.html](http://askjan.org/media/ptsd.html) 

- National Center for PTSD- June is PTSD awareness month  [http://www.ptsd.va.gov/about/ptsd-awareness/ptsd_awareness_month.asp](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/about/ptsd-awareness/ptsd_awareness_month.asp)

### INCLUSION TIP #2: Welcoming Statements 

Implement strategies and processes to make all people feel welcome and included in your organization. Diversity can be defined in terms of race, gender, religion, culture, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical and mental abilities, age, parental status, and socio-economics. To ensure people with disabilities feel welcomed, include a statement that offers the availability of reasonable accommodation. Use the social media to alert potential applicants, staff and members that you are a welcoming inclusive organization.   To get started, here are several samples of organizational statements that welcome all aspects of diversity:

### INCLUSION TIP #1: Creating Easily Navigable Work Areas

To inform everyone who is using a specific office or cubicle, affix nameplates with a photograph as well as Braille and text name of the individual. People who do not read, have issues with memory or speak another language will benefit from viewing an individual’s photograph.
