###INCLUSION TIP #11: PTSD and Low-Stress Environments
Reduce or provide advance notice of any environmental triggers such as loud noises, stress-producing imagery, or flash photography to decrease flashbacks or stress reaction.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop in response to a traumatic event that has caused intense fear, helplessness, or horror (National Association of Mental Illness). Among military veterans, combat-related PTSD is quite common. Some may experience feelings of watchfulness, being "on edge," exaggerated jumpiness, and/or being easily as a result of PTSD (Anxiety Disorder Association of America). Create an inclusive environment by giving advance warning to all team members about possible noisy construction, videos or pictures that include images of war or combat, or other sources of loud sounds or light that may cause flashbacks or other challenges in your organizational environment.

###INCLUSION TIP #10: Diversity Potluck
Create an opportunity for the diverse members of your team to share their culinary culture. 

The expression "American as apple pie" is a common way to identify something that authentically reflects our national history and identity. Yet the reality is that with the vast number of immigrants and other diverse voices that have contributed to the contours of modern American culture, the use of any one food as a symbol of true Americanism begs the question, "Yes, but what about all the rest?"

Following up on our TIP on June 31st of putting up a Diversity Calendar [https://www.nationalserviceresources.org/forum/28661/31986/weekly-inclusion-tip-4-diversity-calendar] (https://www.nationalserviceresources.org/forum/28661/31986/weekly-inclusion-tip-4-diversity-calendar), we suggest encouraging your team members to bring in a dish to contribute to a Diversity Potluck of the various celebrations from the Diversity Calendar you put together. This may include religious, ethnic, or national celebrations and their traditional foods, or it might create an opportunity for more creative culinary observations of social and cultural landmarks. Maintain an inclusive approach by asking for religious or health-related food and eating requests ahead of time so that all team members can participate. Creating this opportunity for sharing will promote dialogue as well as a culture of inclusion, a celebration of history, and an emphasis on the importance of diversity among your team.

###INCLUSION TIP #9: The 36-Inch Rule
Do a physical layout assessment to ensure accessibility.

Nowadays, much more consideration is being given to making office spaces physically accessible for people with a diverse set of physical abilities and preferences. However, many small issues can be overlooked, a fact which can be remedied with a minimum of cost, effort, and time.

Conduct a walk-through in your office and assess the physical accessibility of your location. Walking spaces should have a minimum width of 36 inches; often clutter and shelving can block this. Work stations and storage closets at varying heights can provide the option for individuals using wheelchairs or scooters and differently sized employees to define their own space. Consider providing desk lamps for those with a visual disability. Even checking sign location and formatting (font use, contrast, etc.) can reinforce your organizational focus on diversity and prioritization of diverse abilities and perspectives. Use the City of College Station's checklist [http://www.cstx.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=15034] http://www.cstx.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=15034 or the link for the South Carolina State Library's requirements for physical accessibility [http://www.statelibrary.sc.gov/docs/Facility/accessible_requirements.pdf]  http://www.statelibrary.sc.gov/docs/Facility/accessible_requirements.pdf for starting points.

###INCLUSION TIP #8: Print Materials 
Make your print materials accessible and inclusive. 

It is easy to make assumptions about the cultural, physical, linguistic, and psychological ways of being of those around us. As a member of an organization that strives to be more inclusive, you can help support your organization's diversity by reviewing the visual materials you use and adapting them to Universal Design standards (for an example, see [http://www.healthliteracy.com/article.asp?PageID=3812](http://www.healthliteracy.com/article.asp?PageID=3812)). 

Make your print materials easier to read for those with low vision, non-native speakers of English, and other team members who may benefit from visually presented information, using 14-point sans serif fonts (like Verdana and Arial) for documents and larger sizes for signs and presentations and high contrast (black type on white backgrounds) whenever possible. These small changes will make visual information accessible to a greater number of members of your organization whose distinct abilities, identities, and preferences are accounted for. For more information and ready-to-use checklists for reviewing print materials, visit [http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/inclusive-communications/channels/publishing.php](http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/inclusive-communications/channels/publishing.php).

###Inclusion TIP #7: Scent-Free Policies

Institute a scent-free policy in your organization or agency.

The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) describes fragrance sensitivity as "an irritation or an allergic reaction to some chemical, or combination of chemicals, in a product" [http://askjan.org/media/fragrance.html] (http://askjan.org/media/fragrance.html). Scented products we use on a daily basis (cleaning products, perfumes, air fresheners, etc.) may contain scents that impact others' health and comfort level. Creating a policy that explicitly outlines your organization's goals for an allergy- and irritation-free zone can promote a more inclusive environment by making scent-free the standard. Anticipating the needs of those with allergies, respiratory illness, and other sensitivities to scents helps move your organization from the need of an individual to request an accommodation to true inclusion of all ways of being.
 
Here is an example of a scent-free policy from the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety: [http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/scent_free.html#_1_9] (http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/scent_free.html#_1_9 ). You may also find specific examples of language used around scent-free policies for staff communications, memos, and other forms of policy language on the JAN website (see the link to the JAN website above).

###Inclusion TIP #6: Walkathons, Gift Drives, Fundraisers

Becoming a more inclusive organization that puts diversity and equal participation for all its members at the core of its culture can be reflected in its participation in community-based activities. Look for opportunities in your area to contribute to fundraising and other efforts to support socially-minded missions that benefits individuals from different identity groups and life experiences, such as low-income and homeless community members, people with disabilities, and people struggling with diseases such as AIDS. Encouraging your team to give back to the local community and its diverse members reflects a similar mission within your organization while representing this mission as you benefit from free self-promotion in your local area.

Information for local opportunities to participate in fundraising and other efforts can be found on community websites in your area; examples include [MassEquality](http://www.massequality.org/), [Special Olympics Chicago] (http://www.allcommunityevents.com/chi_town_half_marathon/chi_town_half_mar_charity.html), and the [Avon Walk for Breast Cancer] (http://www.avonwalk.org/new-york/fundraising.html).

###INCLUSION TIP #5: Does your leadership represent diversity?
 
To ensure your organization is truly inclusive, start at the top with your advisory or governing board, commission or council. Does your leadership represent diversity? Identify individual board members' skills, professional expertise, and life experiences so that you can analyze what strengths you have today and what you will need in the future. A qualified board member with personal and/or professional experience with disability can assist an organization in being welcoming, accessible and accommodating to individuals with disabilities.

###INCLUSION TIP #4: Create a Diversity Calendar

Diversity is not only a representation of different cultural categories and values in an organization; it also represents a dialog between those belonging to different groups as they contribute to a community that values each voice and perspective as well as the whole. One way to invite these contributions is to create a diversity calendar to be posted in common areas of your organization. Such a calendar may include religious, secular, local, non-American and international holidays, as well as landmark legal decisions and markers of social and political change (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, effective July 26, 1990). Creating a diversity calendar can provide both the opportunity for members of your team to recognize cultural celebrations of all types, as well as the means to learn more about each other by sharing these celebrations.   

Here is a good example of a diversity calendar, which you can use as a model or a starting point for your organization: [http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf](http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf)

###INCLUSION TIP #3: Post Traumatic Stress (PTS)  
Post Traumatic Stress (PTS) is a debilitating condition that can occur after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Many people with PTS may re-experience the incident in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts, especially when they are exposed to events or objects that recall the trauma. Providing a secure, private room or quiet, enclosed space can allow the individual to reduce stress or comfortably practice relaxation exercises. Offering a private office space might also benefit others including nursing mothers or individuals who need make a call to their doctors or counselors. Identifying this space before anyone has to ask for this accommodation and advertising openly to all staff and members is a positive inclusive practice!   

To learn more about those who are affected by PTS, here are some websites to gather more information or resources:

- JAN Accommodation Resources  [http://askjan.org/media/ptsd.html](http://askjan.org/media/ptsd.html) 

- National Center for PTSD- June is PTSD awareness month  [http://www.ptsd.va.gov/about/ptsd-awareness/ptsd_awareness_month.asp](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/about/ptsd-awareness/ptsd_awareness_month.asp)

### INCLUSION TIP #2: Welcoming Statements 

Implement strategies and processes to make all people feel welcome and included in your organization. Diversity can be defined in terms of race, gender, religion, culture, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical and mental abilities, age, parental status, and socio-economics. To ensure people with disabilities feel welcomed, include a statement that offers the availability of reasonable accommodation. Use the social media to alert potential applicants, staff and members that you are a welcoming inclusive organization.   To get started, here are several samples of organizational statements that welcome all aspects of diversity:

### INCLUSION TIP #1: Creating Easily Navigable Work Areas

To inform everyone who is using a specific office or cubicle, affix nameplates with a photograph as well as Braille and text name of the individual. People who do not read, have issues with memory or speak another language will benefit from viewing an individual’s photograph.
