<h3 id='inclusion_tip_4_create_a_diversity_calendar'>INCLUSION TIP #4: Create a Diversity Calendar</h3>

<p>Diversity is not only a representation of different cultural categories and values in an organization; it also represents a dialog between those belonging to different groups as they contribute to a community that values each voice and perspective as well as the whole. One way to invite these contributions is to create a diversity calendar to be posted in common areas of your organization. Such a calendar may include religious, secular, local, non-American and international holidays, as well as landmark legal decisions and markers of social and political change (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, effective July 26, 1990). Creating a diversity calendar can provide both the opportunity for members of your team to recognize cultural celebrations of all types, as well as the means to learn more about each other by sharing these celebrations.   </p>

<p>Here is a good example of a diversity calendar, which you can use as a model or a starting point for your organization: <a href='http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf'>http://diversiton.com/2013/Calendars/documents/LancasterUniversityDiversityCalendar2013.pdf</a> <hr /></p>

<h3 id='inclusion_tip_3_post_traumatic_stress_pts'>INCLUSION TIP #3: Post Traumatic Stress (PTS)  </h3>

<p>Post Traumatic Stress (PTS) is a debilitating condition that can occur after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Many people with PTS may re-experience the incident in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts, especially when they are exposed to events or objects that recall the trauma. Providing a secure, private room or quiet, enclosed space can allow the individual to reduce stress or comfortably practice relaxation exercises. Offering a private office space might also benefit others including nursing mothers or individuals who need make a call to their doctors or counselors. Identifying this space before anyone has to ask for this accommodation and advertising openly to all staff and members is a positive inclusive practice!   </p>

<p>To learn more about those who are affected by PTS, here are some websites to gather more information or resources:</p>

<h3 id='inclusion_tip_2_welcoming_statements'>INCLUSION TIP #2: Welcoming Statements </h3>

<p>Implement strategies and processes to make all people feel welcome and included in your organization. Diversity can be defined in terms of race, gender, religion, culture, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical and mental abilities, age, parental status, and socio-economics. To ensure people with disabilities feel welcomed, include a statement that offers the availability of reasonable accommodation. Use the social media to alert potential applicants, staff and members that you are a welcoming inclusive organization.   To get started, here are several samples of organizational statements that welcome all aspects of diversity:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href='http://www.tides.org/about/jobs/'>http://www.tides.org/about/jobs/</a></p>

<p>To inform everyone who is using a specific office or cubicle, affix nameplates with a photograph as well as Braille and text name of the individual. People who do not read, have issues with memory or speak another language will benefit from viewing an individual’s photograph. <hr /></p>
